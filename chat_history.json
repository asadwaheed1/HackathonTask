Instead of paying a lump sum upfront or in larger installments, you pay a set amount (or a variable amount depending on usage) each month to cover the cost.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Regular Intervals:** You make a payment approximately every 30 days.\n*   **Covers Past Usage:** The payment typically covers the services or products you've *already* used in the previous month.\n*   **Budgeting:** Monthly billing can help you budget your expenses, as you know a recurring cost is coming due each month.\n\nIs there anything specific about a monthly bill you'd like to know? For example, are you wondering about a specific service, payment methods, due dates, or something else?\n"
